## Agent evaluation

```
python scripts/windows_check/run_windows_check.py eval --only html-complex-budget-to-xlsx --repeat 3 --min-passes 2
```

Claude Code CLI 2.1.295 (Claude Code), model CLI default, launch mode `default`. **1/1 tasks passed**, 0 skipped. Each task passes with at least 2 of 3 runs. **0 wrong-tool calls** (file-based write tools called on a document open in WPS, counted for open-document tasks). **7 off-path calls**, 0 of them after the task's first write (calls to tools the task does not need). **0 writes whose verified_state.passed is not true** (listed under Runs). Task workspaces: `C:\Users\admin\AppData\Local\Temp\wps-windows-check\20261018T045319Z-d126c8c-eval`.

| Task | Passes | Turns | `wps-agent` calls | Tool errors | `wrong_tool_calls` | `off_path_calls` | after the write | `off_path_tools` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `html-complex-budget-to-xlsx` | 3/3 | 10.7 (6, 14, 12) | 13 | 0 |  | 7 | 0 | `inspect_env`, `register_document`, `spreadsheet_read`, `spreadsheet_sheets` |

### Runs

- Nothing to report.

### Documents WPS had open outside the task workspaces

Listed right after the fixture opened. WPS reopens the documents of its previous session when it starts; they are the machine user's, so they are recorded here and left open.

- None.

### WPS processes after the run

- None.
